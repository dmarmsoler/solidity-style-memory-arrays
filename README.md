# Secure Smart Contracts with Isabelle/Solidity

This is a shallow embedding of [Solidity 0.8](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/) in [Isabelle/HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).

## Content

Isabelle/Solidity consists of the following theories:

- `Utils.thy`: A set of general functions and lemmas independent of Solidity.
- `State_Monad`: A formalizaton of a state monad with exceptions and non-termination. It provides also a new mode sm for the partial function package.
- `State.thy`: A formalization of the Solidity storage model consisting of definitions for storage, memory, calldata, and stack. In addition it contains several useful functions for the different types of stores such as functions to read data structures from one store to another.
- `Solidity.thy`: A formalization of Solidity expressions and statements in terms of our state monad.
- `WP.thy`: A weakest precondition calculus and corresponding verification condition generator for our Solidity monads.
- `Unit_tests.thy`: A test suite to validate conformance of the semantics to the original Solidity documentation. The test cases were executed using the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
- `Contract.thy`: An Isabelle/ML implementation of two new commands: `contract` and `invariant` to support the specification of Solidity contracts and verification of invariants in Isabelle.
- `Solidity_Main.thy`: Main entry point
- `Token.thy`: A formalization of a simple banking contract and verification of a key invariant using Isabelle/Solidity.
- `Casino.thy`: A formalization of a casino contract and verification of a key invariant using Isabelle/Solidity.
- `Voting.thy`: A formalization of a delegated voting contract and verification of a key invariant using Isabelle/Solidity.

## Prerequisites

The formalization requires [Isabelle 2023](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/). Please follow the instructions on the Isabelle home page for your operating system.

In the following, we assume that the ``isabelle`` tool is available on the command line. This might require to add the Isabelle binary directory to the ``PATH`` environment variable of your system.

## Using the Formalization

The formalization can be loaded into Isabelle/jEdit by executing 

```sh
isabelle jedit Solidity.thy
```

on the command line. Alternatively, you can start Isabelle/jEdit by 
clicking on the Isabelle icon and loading the theory 
[Solidity_Main.thy](./Solidity_Main.thy) manually. 

To use a command line build that also generates a PDF document,
first add ``path/to/solidity`` to your Isabelle roots file which is
a file called ``ROOTS`` in your Isabelle home directory.
Then, the build can be started by executing:

```sh
isabelle build -D .
```
